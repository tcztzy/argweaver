   argweaver

This directory contains an R package to aid plotting ARGweaver results

To install the package, use

.. code-block:: bash

   R -e "renv::restore()"


in the project root directory.

Some functions require the packages "ape" or "rphast" to be installed as well.
All of them are included in the renv.lock
