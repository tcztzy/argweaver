# Introduction

The original ARGweaver is written in C++ and Python, and the ARGweaver-D is written in C++ and R. This project is aimed to rewrite the entire code from C++ to Rust, and to provide a more time-efficient and user-friendly tool for the community.

# Architecture

This project is divided into two parts: the legacy C++/R codes, and the new Rust/Python codes. The legacy codes are kept for reference and comparison, and the new codes are designed to be more efficient and user-friendly.
